# Theoretical Foundations

## Abstract

This document presents the mathematical foundations underlying the Cidadão.AI anomaly detection system. We provide formal definitions, theoretical analysis, and mathematical proofs for the core algorithms employed in government data transparency analysis. The theoretical framework encompasses statistical anomaly detection, ensemble learning theory, and explainable AI principles.

## 1. Formal Problem Statement

### 1.1 Anomaly Detection Framework

Let $\mathcal{D} = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ be a dataset of government transactions, where each $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ represents a $d$-dimensional feature vector containing financial, temporal, and metadata attributes.

**Definition 1.1** (Anomaly): An anomaly is defined as an observation $x_i$ that deviates significantly from the expected pattern of normal behavior, formally:

$$
\text{Anomaly}(x_i) = \mathbb{I}[\rho(x_i, \mathcal{N}) > \tau]
$$

where:
- $\rho(x_i, \mathcal{N})$ is a deviation measure from the normal distribution $\mathcal{N}$
- $\tau$ is a threshold parameter
- $\mathbb{I}[\cdot]$ is the indicator function

### 1.2 Multi-Modal Data Representation

Government transactions exhibit multi-modal characteristics. We represent each transaction as:

$$
x_i = (f_i^{num}, f_i^{cat}, f_i^{text}, f_i^{temp}, f_i^{graph})
$$

where:
- $f_i^{num} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1}$: numerical features (amounts, quantities)
- $f_i^{cat} \in \{0,1\}^{d_2}$: categorical features (suppliers, departments)
- $f_i^{text} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_3}$: text embeddings (descriptions, justifications)
- $f_i^{temp} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_4}$: temporal features (seasonality, trends)
- $f_i^{graph} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_5}$: graph features (network relationships)

## 2. Statistical Anomaly Detection

### 2.1 Isolation Forest Theory

The Isolation Forest algorithm exploits the principle that anomalies are "few and different," making them easier to isolate.

**Theorem 2.1** (Isolation Principle): For a randomly selected point $x$ from a dataset $\mathcal{D}$, the expected path length $E[h(x)]$ in an isolation tree satisfies:

$$
E[h(x)] = \begin{cases}
2H(n-1) - \frac{2(n-1)}{n} & \text{if } x \text{ is normal} \\
O(\log n) & \text{if } x \text{ is anomalous}
\end{cases}
$$

where $H(i)$ is the harmonic number and $n = |\mathcal{D}|$.

**Proof**: Consider the binary tree construction process. For normal points, the isolation path follows the average case of binary search tree construction, yielding $E[h(x)] = 2H(n-1) - \frac{2(n-1)}{n}$. For anomalous points, the isolation occurs early due to their distinctiveness, resulting in logarithmic path lengths. □

### 2.2 Anomaly Score Normalization

The raw path length is normalized to produce interpretable anomaly scores:

$$
s(x, n) = 2^{-\frac{E[h(x)]}{c(n)}}
$$

where $c(n) = 2H(n-1) - \frac{2(n-1)}{n}$ is the average path length of unsuccessful search in BST.

**Theorem 2.2** (Score Bounds): The anomaly score $s(x, n)$ satisfies:
- $s(x, n) \to 1$ as $E[h(x)] \to 0$ (clear anomaly)
- $s(x, n) \to 0.5$ as $E[h(x)] \to c(n)$ (normal point)
- $s(x, n) \to 0$ as $E[h(x)] \to n-1$ (very normal)

### 2.3 Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

**Definition 2.1** (Local Reachability Density): For a point $x$ and neighborhood size $k$:

$$
\text{lrd}_k(x) = \frac{1}{\frac{\sum_{y \in N_k(x)} \text{reach-dist}_k(x, y)}{|N_k(x)|}}
$$

where $\text{reach-dist}_k(x, y) = \max\{k\text{-distance}(y), d(x, y)\}$.

**Definition 2.2** (Local Outlier Factor): 

$$
\text{LOF}_k(x) = \frac{\sum_{y \in N_k(x)} \frac{\text{lrd}_k(y)}{\text{lrd}_k(x)}}{|N_k(x)|}
$$

**Theorem 2.3** (LOF Properties): The LOF satisfies:
1. $\text{LOF}_k(x) \approx 1$ for normal points
2. $\text{LOF}_k(x) > 1$ for outliers
3. $\text{LOF}_k(x) < 1$ for inliers in dense regions

## 3. Ensemble Learning Theory

### 3.1 Ensemble Framework

Our ensemble combines $M$ base anomaly detectors: $\{h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_M\}$.

**Definition 3.1** (Ensemble Anomaly Score): The ensemble prediction is:

$$
H(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{M} w_i h_i(x)
$$

where $w_i \geq 0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{M} w_i = 1$.

### 3.2 Bias-Variance Decomposition

**Theorem 3.1** (Ensemble Error Decomposition): For the squared error loss, the ensemble error decomposes as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[(H(x) - y)^2] = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \sigma^2
$$

where:
- $\text{Bias}^2 = (\mathbb{E}[H(x)] - y)^2$
- $\text{Variance} = \mathbb{E}[(H(x) - \mathbb{E}[H(x)])^2]$
- $\sigma^2$ is irreducible error

**Corollary 3.1**: For uncorrelated base learners with equal weights:

$$
\text{Variance}(H) = \frac{1}{M} \cdot \text{Variance}(h_i)
$$

This theoretical result justifies ensemble methods for variance reduction.

### 3.3 Diversity Measures

**Definition 3.2** (Pairwise Diversity): For classifiers $h_i$ and $h_j$:

$$
\text{Div}(h_i, h_j) = \frac{N^{01} + N^{10}}{N^{00} + N^{01} + N^{10} + N^{11}}
$$

where $N^{ab}$ represents the number of examples classified as $a$ by $h_i$ and $b$ by $h_j$.

**Theorem 3.2** (Diversity-Accuracy Trade-off): There exists an optimal diversity level $\delta^*$ that maximizes ensemble performance:

$$
\delta^* = \arg\max_{\delta} \left[ \text{Accuracy}(\delta) - \lambda \cdot \text{Cost}(\delta) \right]
$$

## 4. Deep Learning Foundations

### 4.1 Variational Autoencoder Theory

Our VAE-based anomaly detector follows the framework:

**Definition 4.1** (VAE Objective): The VAE optimizes the Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO):

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)] - D_{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) \| p(z))
$$

where:
- $q_\phi(z|x)$: encoder (recognition model)
- $p_\theta(x|z)$: decoder (generative model)
- $p(z) = \mathcal{N}(0, I)$: prior distribution

### 4.2 Reconstruction-Based Anomaly Detection

**Theorem 4.1** (Reconstruction Error Bound): For a well-trained VAE, the reconstruction error for normal data is bounded:

$$
\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{normal}}[\|x - \hat{x}\|^2] \leq \epsilon_{normal}
$$

while for anomalous data:

$$
\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{anomaly}}[\|x - \hat{x}\|^2] \geq \epsilon_{anomaly} > \epsilon_{normal}
$$

**Proof Sketch**: Normal data lie in the learned manifold, leading to low reconstruction error. Anomalous data deviate from this manifold, causing higher reconstruction error. □

### 4.3 Reparameterization Trick

The reparameterization enables backpropagation through stochastic nodes:

$$
z = \mu + \sigma \odot \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
$$

This transformation maintains differentiability while introducing stochasticity.

## 5. Explainable AI Theory

### 5.1 SHAP Values

**Definition 5.1** (Shapley Value): For a cooperative game $(N, v)$, the Shapley value for player $i$ is:

$$
\phi_i(v) = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!(|N| - |S| - 1)!}{|N|!} [v(S \cup \{i\}) - v(S)]
$$

**Theorem 5.1** (SHAP Uniqueness): SHAP values are the unique attribution method satisfying:
1. **Efficiency**: $\sum_{i=1}^{d} \phi_i = f(x) - f(\emptyset)$
2. **Symmetry**: If $v(S \cup \{i\}) = v(S \cup \{j\})$ for all $S$, then $\phi_i = \phi_j$
3. **Dummy**: If $v(S \cup \{i\}) = v(S)$ for all $S$, then $\phi_i = 0$
4. **Additivity**: For $v = u + w$, $\phi_i(v) = \phi_i(u) + \phi_i(w)$

### 5.2 Kernel SHAP

For complex models, we use Kernel SHAP with the weighted linear kernel:

$$
\pi_{x'}(z') = \frac{M-1}{\binom{M}{|z'|}|z'|(M-|z'|)}
$$

where $|z'|$ is the number of non-zero elements in $z'$.

## 6. Statistical Guarantees

### 6.1 Concentration Inequalities

**Theorem 6.1** (Hoeffding's Inequality): For independent random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ with $a_i \leq X_i \leq b_i$, the sample mean $\bar{X}$ satisfies:

$$
P(|\bar{X} - \mathbb{E}[\bar{X}]| \geq t) \leq 2\exp\left(-\frac{2n^2t^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(b_i - a_i)^2}\right)
$$

This provides confidence bounds for our anomaly score estimates.

### 6.2 Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning

**Definition 6.1** (PAC Learnability): A concept class $\mathcal{C}$ is PAC-learnable if there exists an algorithm that, for any $\epsilon, \delta > 0$, produces a hypothesis $h$ such that:

$$
P[\text{error}(h) \leq \epsilon] \geq 1 - \delta
$$

with sample complexity polynomial in $1/\epsilon$, $1/\delta$, and problem size.

### 6.3 Generalization Bounds

**Theorem 6.2** (Rademacher Complexity Bound): With probability at least $1-\delta$:

$$
\text{error}(h) \leq \hat{\text{error}}(h) + 2\mathfrak{R}_n(\mathcal{H}) + \sqrt{\frac{\log(1/\delta)}{2n}}
$$

where $\mathfrak{R}_n(\mathcal{H})$ is the Rademacher complexity of hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$.

## 7. Information-Theoretic Analysis

### 7.1 Mutual Information

**Definition 7.1** (Mutual Information): For random variables $X$ and $Y$:

$$
I(X; Y) = \int \int p(x, y) \log \frac{p(x, y)}{p(x)p(y)} dx dy
$$

This measures the information shared between features and anomaly labels.

### 7.2 Feature Selection Criterion

We select features that maximize mutual information with anomaly labels:

$$
\mathcal{F}^* = \arg\max_{|\mathcal{F}| \leq k} I(\mathcal{F}; Y)
$$

subject to the constraint $|\mathcal{F}| \leq k$ for computational efficiency.

## 8. Convergence Analysis

### 8.1 Stochastic Gradient Descent

**Theorem 8.1** (SGD Convergence): For strongly convex functions with Lipschitz gradients, SGD with learning rate $\eta_t = \frac{1}{\mu t}$ achieves:

$$
\mathbb{E}[f(x_t) - f(x^*)] \leq \frac{2\sigma^2}{\mu^2 t}
$$

where $\mu$ is the strong convexity parameter and $\sigma^2$ is the gradient noise variance.

### 8.2 Adam Optimizer Analysis

**Theorem 8.2** (Adam Convergence): Under standard assumptions, Adam with learning rate $\alpha_t = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{t}}$ satisfies:

$$
\sum_{t=1}^{T} \mathbb{E}[\|\nabla f(x_t)\|^2] \leq \frac{2(f(x_1) - f(x^*))\sqrt{T}}{\alpha(1-\beta_1)} + \frac{G^2\alpha\sqrt{T}}{(1-\beta_1)(1-\beta_2)}
$$

## 9. Computational Complexity

### 9.1 Time Complexity Analysis

| Algorithm | Training | Inference | Space |
|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Isolation Forest | $O(t \psi \log \psi)$ | $O(t \log \psi)$ | $O(t \psi)$ |
| LOF | $O(n^2)$ | $O(k \log n)$ | $O(n^2)$ |
| One-Class SVM | $O(n^3)$ | $O(n_{sv})$ | $O(n^2)$ |
| VAE | $O(epochs \cdot batch \cdot d)$ | $O(d)$ | $O(d^2)$ |

where $t$ is number of trees, $\psi$ is subsample size, $n$ is dataset size, $k$ is neighborhood size, $n_{sv}$ is number of support vectors, and $d$ is feature dimension.

### 9.2 Parallel Complexity

**Theorem 9.1** (Parallel Speedup): For embarrassingly parallel algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest), the speedup with $p$ processors is:

$$
S(p) = \frac{T_1}{T_p} \leq \frac{p}{1 + (p-1)f}
$$

where $f$ is the fraction of sequential computation (Amdahl's law).

## 10. Robustness Analysis

### 10.1 Adversarial Robustness

**Definition 10.1** (Adversarial Example): For input $x$ and perturbation $\delta$ with $\|\delta\| \leq \epsilon$:

$$
x_{adv} = x + \delta \text{ such that } f(x_{adv}) \neq f(x)
$$

**Theorem 10.1** (Certified Defense): Our ensemble provides certified robustness radius:

$$
r_{cert} = \min_{i} r_i \cdot w_i
$$

where $r_i$ is the individual robustness radius of detector $i$.

### 10.2 Statistical Robustness

**Definition 10.2** (Breakdown Point): The breakdown point $\epsilon^*$ is the smallest fraction of contamination that can arbitrarily change the estimator:

$$
\epsilon^* = \min\{\epsilon : \sup_{\mathcal{D}'\in \mathcal{N}_\epsilon(\mathcal{D})} \|T(\mathcal{D}') - T(\mathcal{D})\| = \infty\}
$$

For our ensemble, $\epsilon^* = \frac{1}{2M}$ where $M$ is the number of base detectors.
